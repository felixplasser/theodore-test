Test of TDDFT in ADF on the formaldehyde dimer.
A random ordering of the atoms is chosen to make
sure that the interface treats this correctly.

There is one run with the old interface
tden.in.4
and two runs with the new interface
tden.in.2adf  tden.in.4adf

This test requires a working ADF installation.
