Pyridine: compare the readout of ricc2.out with the binary readout.
   Reasonable agreement but it is observed that the readout of ricc2.out is not very precise:
   For example the 1(3)a2 and 1(1)a2 have exactly the same Omega matrices because not
   enough configurations are read.

This also tests the TM version.
   CCRE0-2--1---1 and CCRE0-2--3---1 are created with TM V7.2,
   the other files with TM V6.3.1
